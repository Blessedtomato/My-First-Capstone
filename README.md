From the interactive charts, we are able to find out

-Pie chart on number of stroke patients 

-Column charts on age groups that have stroke

-Column charts on what are the factors that lead to stroke by comparison

# What have I learnt from the analysis?

On the left hand side of my dashboard, I have input two slicers, one is for filtering out the age groups and the other one is to see the amount of stroke patients.

Based on the dataset, i can conclude that age and BMI are the main factors that affect stroke because they are relatively high. 
Smoking, hypertension and heart diseases doesn't contribute to the factor of stroke.

# changes made

Data cleaning(inserting fomulae for bmi and age group,remove duplicates,remove N/A)

Create pivot table, add charts and slicers.
